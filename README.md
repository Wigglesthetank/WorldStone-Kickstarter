WORLD STONE - a game where players can make money while they play.

3rd person action combat MMORPG
  Player to player economy, Professions have real worth and information is everything. 
    Questing is a lot more than killing 10 boars. Lore does matter and will be involved with the quests that can lead to great rewards.
      Loot has quality rating which can lead to faster repairs and less damage or less repairs and more damage.
      
      Real money Trading will have limitations in the trade market to keep players frombuying their way to the top. 
        Once a player buys an item they will have to work on its efficiency(tier of the weapon) as well as character level and other prerequisites. 
        
        Items will have value only equal to what someone is willing to pay for it and the players are selling to other players.


    **The purpose behind this is that I want this to be a global game where people that don't make much money can make money playing games they enjoy.**



Developed with Unreal Engine 4.27.2
